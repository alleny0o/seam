# Typecheck, Lint, and Prettier Checks

## What to do after every code edit

After you make any code change (edits to files like `*.ts`, `*.tsx`, configuration, build scripts, etc.), immediately run these quality checks in the project root:

```bash
npm run typecheck
npm run lint
npm run format:check
```

- If the Prettier check fails, run `npm run format` to auto-fix formatting, then re-run the three checks.
- If typecheck or lint fails, stop and fix issues before proceeding.

## Rationale

This repository uses TypeScript, ESLint, and Prettier. Running these checks early avoids broken builds and inconsistent formatting.

## Notes

- Use `npm` (there is a `package-lock.json`), not `pnpm` or `yarn`.
- Relevant scripts (from `package.json`):
  - `typecheck`: `tsc --noEmit`
  - `lint`: `eslint --no-error-on-unmatched-pattern .`
  - `format:check`: `prettier --check --ignore-unknown .`
  - `format`: `prettier --write --ignore-unknown .`
